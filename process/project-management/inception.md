# Projections \(estimations\)

### Scoping

* inceptions are mostly about “why”
* try to cut similar sized chunks of work
* alternatively, estimate t-shirt sizes: S/M/L or 1, 2, 3
* PM, customer, QA should estimate as a sanity check ONLY
* designers’ estimates can be included with devs’ estimates
* try to estimate on a weekly basis... anything finer grained than that is likely self-delusion
* fill up 3 weeks and take an average, and then check: does it feel right?

## Measurement

* “yesterday’s weather” is _usually_ very accurate
* if you don't have yesterday's weather, default to 2 points or M
* give yourself a wider window \(2 or 3 weeks\) to avoid sharp spikes at Holi
* prefer one week iterations as a basic skeleton
* prefer the simplest estimation possible
* never change estimation approach mid-project
* DO NOT compensate for “irregularities” – sick leave is real, holidays are real
* consider making an exception for serious illness, weddings, sabbaticals and unexpected events

## Projection

* take what was measured, mark it against the scope, project into the future
* do not adjust, do not compensate, do not pad work/estimates
* pad the end \(of a release, of a project\) for inevitable changes
* be honest with everyone about what you see
