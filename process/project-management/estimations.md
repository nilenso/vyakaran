# Estimation

### Scoping

* Inceptions are mostly about the _why_
* Try to cut similar sized chunks of work
* Alternatively, estimate t-shirt sizes: S/M/L or 1, 2, 3
* PM, customer, QA should estimate as a sanity check ONLY
* Designers’ estimates can be included with devs’ estimates
* Try to estimate on a weekly basis... anything finer grained than that is likely self-delusion
* Fill up 3 weeks and take an average, and then check: does it feel right?

### Measurement

* _Yesterday’s weather_ is usually very accurate
* If you don't have yesterday's weather, default to 2 points or M
* Give yourself a wider window \(2 or 3 weeks\) to avoid sharp spikes at Holi
* Prefer one week iterations as a basic skeleton
* Prefer the simplest estimation possible
* Never change estimation approach mid-project
* **DO NOT** compensate for _irregularities_ – sick leaves and holidays are real
* Consider making an exception for serious illness, weddings, sabbaticals and unexpected events

### Projection

* Take what was measured, mark it against the scope, project into the future
* Do not adjust, do not compensate, do not pad work/estimates
* Pad the end \(of a release, of a project\) for inevitable changes
* Be honest with everyone about what you see
