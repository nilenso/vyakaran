# Iteration Planning Meetings

Our default delivery style is based on the classic Extreme programming methodologies with 1-week iterations, daily standups, TDD, pair programming, and regular communication.

We believe that open lines of communication and planning/projection which employs measurement and reduces guesswork are critical to the success of any project.

Iteration Planning Meetings (IPMs) are valuable to assess what was accomplished (and not) over the previous iteration, and what is planned for the coming iteration.

You should feel free to call out any gaps in your understanding of what needs to be done.
