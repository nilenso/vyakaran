# Iteration Planning Meetings \(IPMs\)

Our default delivery style is based on the classic Extreme programming methodologies with 1-week iterations, daily standups, TDD, pair programming, and regular communication.

We believe that open lines of communication and planning/projection which employs measurement and reduces guesswork are critical to the success of any project.
