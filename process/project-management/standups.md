# Standups

Standups on the project happen every day, with the entire team including PMs, designers, frontend developers, backend developers, devops engineers and QA (regardless of whether they are with the client org, nilenso or another consulting firm) present. 

Standups are meant to be quick catch ups to provide an update as to where you are and to surface blockers.

Ensure that meeting updates are crisp and to the point. Questions you have for specific members of the team based on their updates should be raised separately, in order to avoid taking up everyone's time.
