### Making a purchase

When signing up for new services, use bills@nilenso.com where possible, so invoices are automatically sent to this email ID. In other cases, forward a copy of the invoice to bills@nilenso.com

In the invoice, nclude the company's GSTIN/GST number: 29AAKFN2903R1ZM

Additionally, send the bill to kulu, our internal expense tracking solution. Make sure you have an account on kulu before you expense a purchase.

### Tracking the purchase on kulu

#### Through email

* You can only send mails if you have an account under the ''nilenso'' team
* Only submit a single attachment per email, if you have multiple reimbursements, send multiple emails
* kulu only picks the biggest attachment \(in size\) if more than one is attached
* Mention the details in the subject, these will be used as remarks
* PDFs / Images are legit \(beware of inline attachments -- these don't work :\( \)
* Send the email to the **company email** \(if you used company cash/card\) or the **reimbursements email** if you need to be reimbursed for a purchase you made
* The best use-case is when receive an invoice over email. You can just hit forward and send it to kulu \(preferably remove the text "fwd" from the subject\)

#### Through phone

* Get the app from play store 
  * [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nilenso.com.kulu\_mobile2&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nilenso.com.kulu_mobile2&hl=en)
* Click a picture of your expense \(preferably along with the card's customer receipt if any\) and the app will upload it

#### Through the site

* Upload from [https://nilenso.kulu.tech/expenses](https://nilenso.kulu.tech/expenses), edit the details as necessary
