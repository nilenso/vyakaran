# Reviews

### Annual reviews

* Typically held in March 
* We use the reviews app to write reviews for each other
* Suggest a level for the reviewee

### Mid-year reviews

* Typically held in September
* Written on google docs, or gitlab, or the reviews app
* For mid-year unlike final year reviews, no levels are given; this is the time to give feedback without it having any impact on level or salary

### Guidelines

* Try to write reviews for everyone if possible
* Definitely write reviews for people you have worked with closely
* Ideally, nothing in the review is a surprise to the reviewee.
* There is a short discussion \(~30 minutes per person\), which happens across two days

We often recommend the [retrospective starfish model](https://app.gitbook.com/@nilenso/s/playbook/~/drafts/-LlF1l1IVjLjKpmIF5fu/primary/process/reviews/guidelines-on-giving-reviews) for writing reviews. This is more a guideline than anything else, free-flowing text is perfectly fine.

The format doesn't matter. Be honest, and professional. Think about what someone is doing that's great, and what they should work on to get better.
