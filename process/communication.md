# Communication

### Chat

Chat (currently on Slack) is the primary mode of communication at nilenso

#### Channel guidelines

* general is for important company-wide announcements that everyone needs to see
* finance is for important finance-related announcements
* sales is for discussing sales leads including existing clients' contractual changes
* operations is for day-to-day discussions about the office
* space is for discussions relating to the physical office -- what needs to be bought, disposed of, repaired, cared for
* wfh-leaves-ooo is self explanatory, and is for when you're working from home, or out of the office
* sundry is for everything else, don't post anything important here!
* if you're unsure where a message belongs, ask

#### Tagging

* Tag the intended recipients of the message in the message
* Tag @here when you want everyone online to see the message
* Tag @channel when you're making important announcements. Use prudently
* Avoid tagging folks on messages in #sundry or on non-critical messages unless you know they are free
* If someone has taken the effort to type a message intended for you, do respond to it. Not responding _could_ seem like you're ignoring them
* Make time to check internal Chat regularly during core working hours, and respond to messages

#### Formatting

* Format your messages for better readability
* Slack supports markdown. The fundamental principles of a well-formatted message stay the same
  * Break up large pieces of content into smaller chunks
  * Visually segregate the chunks with lines or headers
  * Order lists where that makes sense
  * Bold or italics for emphasis
  * Share snippets of code in blocks
  * Avoid capitalising your message or using title case

#### Timing

* Chat can be used during core and outside working hours as long as you are judicious about tagging

### Email

Email is intended for more formal communication. In the interest of transparency, ensure that the appropriate groups are copied on all company emails

#### Guidelines

* Offers to candidates
* Sales discussions / negotiations
* Summarizing personnel-related discussions
* Leaves
* Resignation
* Long form company-wide messages

#### Tagging

### Face to face

Formal meetings, casual catch ups and everything in between

#### Guidelines

* Interview discussions
* Finstrat meetings
* Daily catch ups
* Everything else

#### Tagging

* Try to "just do it!" whenever you can (especially 1:1 catch ups)
* If specific folks need to be at a meeting, ask them about their availability and send out a meeting invite in advance
* Ensure that there is a video call link so remote folks can join in

#### Timing

* Meetings are not asynchronous, be respectful of time
  * Do not be late
  * Come prepared
  * Take breaks where they make sense
  * The person who convened the meeting should be responsible for wrapping it up on time

#### Tagging
