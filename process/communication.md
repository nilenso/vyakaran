# Communication

### Chat

Chat is the primary mode of communication at nilenso

#### Channel guidelines

* general is for important company-wide announcements that everyone needs to see
* finance is for important finance-related announcements
* operations is for day-to-day discussions about the office
* space is for discussions relating to the physical office -- what needs to be bought, disposed of, repaired, cared for
* wfh-leaves-oo is self explanatory, and is for when you're working from home, or out of the office
* sundry is for everything else, don't post anything important here!
* if you're unsure where a message belongs, ask

#### Tagging

* Tag the intended recipients of the message in the message
* Tag @here when you want everyone online to see the message
* Tag @channel when you want everyone to use the message. Use sparingly
* Avoid tagging folks on messages in \#sundry or on non-critical messages unless you know they are free
* If you are tagged on a message, respond to it, even if to say that you won't have time to participate in the discussion. Know that someone has taken the effort to type a message intended for you, and not responding to it seems like you're ignoring them
* Make time to check Chat every day and respond to messages

#### Formatting

* Format your messages for better readability
* Relay supports markdown \([https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/messaging/formatting-text.html)\) though Slack does not. However the fundamental principles of a well-formatted message stay the same
  * Break up large pieces of content into smaller chunks
  * Visually segregate the chunks with lines or headers \(use title case for headers if appropriate\)
  * Order lists where that makes sense
  * Bold or italics for emphasis
  * Share snippets of code in blocks
  * Avoid capitalising your message or using title case

#### Timing

* Chat can be used during core and outside working hours as long as you are judicious about tagging

### Email

#### Tagging

* Try to "just do it!" whenever you can \(especially 1:1 catch ups\)

* Ensure you have a video call link so remote folks can join in

#### Timing

* Meetings are not asynchronous, be respectful of time
  * Do not be late
  * Come prepared
  * Take breaks where they make sense
  * The person who convened the meeting should be responsible for wrapping it up on time
