# Ideal schedule

### Guideline

* 10.00: Start
  * 10.00: Slack / Relay and emails
  * 11.00: Morning chai
  * 13.30: Lunch
  * 16.00: Evening chai
  * 17.45: Slack / Relay and emails
* 18.00: End

#### Definitions

*   09.30 to 11.00 / 17.00 to 18.30 nilenso hours

    \*\* 09.30 to 11.00 morning nilenso hours

    \*\* 17.00 to 18.30 evening nilenso hours
* 11.00 to 17.00 core pairing hours

#### What happens during core pairing hours

* Almost all days, for almost everyone
  * Project work
* Rarely
  * Unavoidable nilenso work

#### What happens during nilenso hours

* Most days, for most people
  * Project work
* Some days, for some people (more often for some than others)
  * Tuesday standup
  * Internal meetings (eg. finstrat)
  * Staffing-related discussions
  * Paperwork-related work (eg. bank, audit related documents)
  * Office-related discussions (eg. purchases, repairs)
  * Initial phone or in-person interview (unless not possible to schedule during this time)
  * Sales calls (where possible)

#### Exceptions (scheduling nilenso work during core pairing hours)

* Tuesday standup
* Sales calls that cannot be scheduled during nilenso hours
* Interviewee is not available at any other time for an initial interview
* Full day interview
* Something needs to be urgently signed
* Urgent, unavoidable meetings
* Review meetings
* Away days

#### Setting expectations with clients

* A full working month is 120-130 hours
* Some time during the year will involve participating in scheduled nilenso activities, and working on nilenso. Senior folks will work on nilenso more than junior folks
* Communicate leave plans (for the client, this will include review meetings, away days, urgent long nilenso meetings) and nilenso meetings early, clearly and consistently over email and other appropriate media of communication. Send out reminders as necessary. Add this information to your calendar, and set an out of office as appropriate
* Make sure your team is aware of sick leaves as early as possible

#### Setting expectations with nilenso

* There are 2 sets of nilenso hours: morning nilenso hours and evening nilenso hours
* To be fair to everyone (folks who prefer to start early, and to those who prefer to stay late) we will alternate between the morning and evening slots when we schedule meetings
* It is possible that you are not free in either one of the slots. If so, please communicate the fact that you are not available by blocking off that time in your calendar
* Send an email about upcoming leave plans. Communicate leaves early, clearly and consistently at standup. Repeat several times. Add it to your calendar. Set an out of office if you're away for more than 2 days. Log under the appropriate project in Harvest
* Make sure nilenso is aware of sick leaves as early as possible. Log under the appropriate project in Harvest

### Reasoning

* The main objective is to allow for uninterrupted core working hours to most people, most of the time
* We have assumed working hours are 10.00 to 18.00
  * This is a guideline, not a rule
  * Some ensonians may start a bit earlier, or a bit later
  * However, just like any team, it is important to set expectations around when you can reasonably expect your team to be available
