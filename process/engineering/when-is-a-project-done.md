# When is a project done?

### Try and answer these questions

* **Acceptance Criteria**: Who wrote them and did they check? 
* **Testing**: What kinds of testing?
* **Deployed**: Where have you deployed?
* **Usage**: Who is this going to be used by?
* **Feature flags**: Which ones?
* **Old features**: Removed or disabled?
* **Old data**: Deprecated or deleted?
* **Old APIs**: Backward-compatible, deprecated, or deleted? Client libraries?
* **Just one more thing**: Is there anything pending on your plate?
* **Dependencies**: Who owns them?
* **Follow-up**: Who’s talking? Who’s fault is it if it doesn’t happen? (_YOURS_). What happens, if tomorrow, the entire team ceases to exist?

**Maturity means**

* Process
* Documentation
* Automation
* Eliminating process altogether (no ad-hoc work)
