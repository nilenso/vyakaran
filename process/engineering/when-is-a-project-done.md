# When is a project done?

## When is software done?

Try and answer these questions

* acceptance criteria – who wrote them? did they check?
* testing – what kinds?
* deployed – where?
* used – by whom?
* feature flags – which ones?
* old features – removed or disabled?
* old data – deprecated or deleted?
* old APIs – backward-compatible, deprecated, or deleted? client libraries?
* “just one more thing” – is there anything pending on your plate?
* answer this: what happens if you die tomorrow?
* dependencies – who owns them?
* follow-up – who’s talking? who’s fault is it if it doesn’t happen? \(YOURS\)
* what happens if the entire team dies tomorrow?

  maturity means:

  * process
  * documentation
  * automation
  * eliminate process altogether \(zero work, not ad-hoc work\)
