# Leaves

nilenso offers a total of 33 days off in a calendar year

### Statutory holidays

There are 5 statutory holidays, during which the office will remain closed.

* Republic Day \(Jan 26th\), 
* Labour Day \(May 1st\),
* Independence Day \(Aug 15th\), 
* Gandhi Jayanti \(Oct 2nd\) and 
* Rajyotsava \(Nov 1st\) 

### Vacation or sick leave

The remaining 28 days can be taken off as needed.

### Very sick leave

Serious illness is not considered as leave.

### Unpaid leave

Unpaid leave is available during the year if required. Salary deducted will be calculated based on number of calendar days \(not working days\) in the month of the leaves.

### Borrowing future leaves

We know that important personal events require extended periods of time off from work, but can be trying. Rather than taking unpaid leave, up to 10 leaves can be "borrowed" from the next calendar year if required.
