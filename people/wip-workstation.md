# Workstation

This article is a work in progress. Please help by contributing to this article. Do mention changes on the ~operations Relay channel.

Our workstations should be consistent to the degree possible while allowing for individual customizability.

As the default, we should get tables, laptops, chairs, peripherals from the list described below. If there is a strong and valid personal preference to something else, other options can be considered.

### Webcams

* Logitech c920/922 Consider the c922 when the c920 is unavailable. Both are about the same except that the c922 does 60fps \(which does not matter to us\)
* Logitech c930e Wide angle. Better for calls with &gt; 2 people. As a side effect, unless you use logitech software to zoom, the angle can be too wide to the point of being intrusive

### TBD

* laptop
* keyboard
* mouse
* monitor
* cables
* headphones
