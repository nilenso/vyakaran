# Waste management

nilenso believes all waste must be properly segregated and dealt with. **Colour-coded and labeled bins** are placed on every floor of the office. Please use the appropriate bin based on the manner of waste.

* All organic \(wet\) waste should ideally go directly into the composter placed on the terrace
  * Read more about [composting](https://app.gitbook.com/@nilenso/s/playbook/~/edit/drafts/-LlWGjDEXYPuJN25dhrt/place/untitled-1) of wet waste
* Dry waste is placed in the labeled bins segregated and handed over to a private collection service \(daily\) for recycling
* * Paper
  * Plastic
  * Metal
  * Glass
* Reject waste should be put in the red bins labeled "Reject" that are placed on every floor
* Leaf composters are placed outside the office, for leaves from trees on the street as well as from plants in the office
* E-waste is handed over to a collection service, who resell some or all of it, and dispose of the remaining waste properly
