# Interviewing with us

Firstly, thank you. We are privileged that you are interested in applying to us.

A few things you should know about us: 

* We don't rush hiring. It's important to us that we take the time to get to know each other, and to understand each other's our motivations and expectations. If you are working with time constraints, please let us know as early as possible and we will do our best to accommodate you.
* We typically don't hire for specific positions, so our interviews are intended as a discovery of your skillsets and interests. 
* Everyone at a certain level gets paid the same. Our salaries are public internally. Your previous compensation has no bearing on the offer we make you. We will never ask you for payslips.

## Process 

Please tell us about your work \(professional experience, open source contributions, hobby projects\), as well as your interests and passions by writing in to careers@nilenso.com

* Introductory questions or introductory call \(30-45 minutes\)

  * This is where we introduce ourselves to each other, ideally over a video call
  * The objective is to understand your expectations, and make sure we are in alignment. Some of this conversation may be technical
  * While we try to get face time with everyone that applies to us, if we don't have much information about you we may kick off the conversation over email instead

* Take home problem

  * We will ask you to solve a small take home assignment in any language of your choosing
  * We are not merely looking for a functionally correct solution. Clearly calling out your assumptions, having a readme, well documented code, good naming, atomic commits and writing tests make you a better fit for us. Please go through the suggestions we include in the problem we have shared with you
  * We understand that people are busy, so please feel free to let us know how long you need to work through this

* Technical conversations \(60 minutes\)

  * These conversations are often centred around real-world challenges that we have experienced
  * We are not expecting you to come up with a specific response, please treat this as a free-flowing discussion

* Pairing with us \(120 minutes\)

  * Here you will pair with someone from nilenso either on the take home problem you had worked on earlier or a new problem

* Other conversations
  * Throughout the process and sometimes additionally as an explicit conversation, we are assessing if we would both be happy and fulfilled working with each other. We hope you feel comfortable enough to do the same.
