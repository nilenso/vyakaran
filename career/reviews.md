# Reviews

### Annual reviews <a id="annual-reviews"></a>

* Typically held in March 
* We use the reviews app to write reviews for each other
* Suggest a level for the reviewee

### Mid-year reviews <a id="mid-year-reviews"></a>

* Typically held in September
* Written on google docs, or gitlab, or the reviews app
* For mid-year unlike final year reviews, no levels are given; this is the time to give feedback without it having any impact on level or salary

### Guidelines <a id="guidelines"></a>

* Try to write reviews for everyone if possible
* Definitely write reviews for people you have worked with closely
* Ideally, nothing in the review is a surprise to the reviewee.
* There is a short discussion \(~30 minutes per person\), which happens across two days

We often recommend the **retrospective starfish model** for giving feedback. Basically think in terms of what someone should

* start doing
* do more of
* keep doing
* do less of
* stop doing

This is more a guideline than anything else. The format doesn't really matter, free-flowing text is perfectly fine. Be honest, and professional. Think about what someone is doing that's great, and what they should work on to get better.
