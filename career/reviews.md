### Annual reviews <a href="#annual-reviews" id="annual-reviews"></a>

* Typically held in March&#x20;
* We use the reviews app to write reviews for each other
* Suggest a level for the reviewee

### Mid-year reviews <a href="#mid-year-reviews" id="mid-year-reviews"></a>

* Typically held in September
* Written on google docs, or gitlab, or the reviews app
* For mid-year unlike final year reviews, no levels are given; this is the time to give feedback without it having any impact on level or salary

### Guidelines <a href="#guidelines" id="guidelines"></a>

* Try to write reviews for everyone if possible
* Definitely write reviews for people you have worked with closely
* Ideally, nothing in the review is a surprise to the reviewee
* Please feel free to have a conversation (in writing) on the feedback given. The idea is for this to be an open conversation among us
* Incorporate client feedback (where available) in your self review
  * Client reviews offer useful insight that we can learn from
  * At the same time, we understand that it is difficult to compare reviews across clients as there is no common frame of reference
  * We also recognise that our clients may not prioritise the same things we do
  * We account for these factors in our reviews as well as level discussions
* There is a short discussion (\~30 minutes per person) to clarify any outstanding questions, summarise the reviews and note down actionable feedback. This generally happens over two days

We often recommend the **retrospective starfish model** for giving feedback. Basically think in terms of what someone should

* start doing
* do more of
* keep doing
* do less of
* stop doing

This is more a guideline than anything else. The format doesn't really matter, free-flowing text is perfectly fine. Be honest, and professional. While critical feedback is great, a pat on the back is just as welcome, so don't forget to highlight the positives!
