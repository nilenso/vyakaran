# FAQs

## What are the responsibilities handled by each person at Nilenso beyond the day-to-day technical work?

* Apart from working on a project, you would be involved broadly in hiring, mentoring, and sales.
* Hiring involves reviewing code, interviewing candidates, and making sound judgements
* Mentorship at nilenso is more passive than say coaching. People who want to learn from you will pick up things from working with you, without you actively working to teach them. Giving quick, actionable feedback to your team mates, and helping them pick up next-level things effectively is expected, however.
* Most of nilenso’s sales is inbound, so this work involves communicating with potential clients via emails/calls, bringing something to the table during these discussions, and above all, developing a good working relationship with our existing clients.
* Giving talks at conferences, showing up at meetups, and other community activity, is left to individuals based on their interests. This is not an expectation per se, but this adds significant value in the long run in terms of driving sales/hiring.

## How many hours per week does each person spend on internal organizational matters \(setting quarterly/annual goals, hiring decisions, administrative work\)?

* For the seniors, I’d say we average about 8h per week in normal scenarios. People who bill are heads down in work for most of the time.
* Depending on the initiatives \(or experiments\) we choose to pick up, this can be a lot more/less. For example, we did campus hiring this year, and we spent a good part of 2 full weeks doing related work. Another example is running an internship where folks involved might spend up to 10h a week sometimes.
* Currently, three people are elected “suits”, who make executive decisions on a day-to-day basis, and they might spend a lot more time doing internal things. A couple senior people currently bill only 50% of their time to clients to make sure they have time for other things, for example.

## Do you work overtime \(i.e, more than 8 hours per day\)? How often does this happen per month?

* Generally speaking, we don’t do overtime. We have previously added clauses to our contracts with much higher billing rates for overtime, discouraging clients from asking us to do this.
* Working more than 8h a day can happen though. There’s a production issue, or a crunch before a deadline sometimes. Sometimes, the work is super interesting, and we push ourselves to do 12h just so we can keep at it. If we’re onsite in a different city/country, we generally work a lot from not doing much outside of it, by choice.
* The production issues/deadline crunches last a few days once in a few months, depending on the stability of the project, and scale of software involved.
* Most people work at 70/80% capacity for most of the time. We generally plan for 110/120h a month per person.

## Do you work on weekends? How often does this happen per month?

* We generally have a hard preference to not work on weekends, and we push back hard when there’s a need for it.
* I want to say we never do this. But we have previously faced some prod issues on weekends \(higher traffic, etc\).

## How are you tackling the diversity problem at nilenso? Do you consider this a problem at all?

* Women at nilenso: Currently, we have 4 women \(deepa, nid, sezal, and akshatha\) who are devs/billable. Pavithra is the office admin, and kala and renuka are our ops staff. nid and deepa are both in leadership positions at nilenso, which is extremely rare \(even in companies that have better diversity numbers overall\).
* Considering just the billable folks, 4/18 is low. We’re very aware of this, and consider it a critical issue.
* Our \(realistic\) hiring goals for the year in this regard are to hire at least 2 more women, one of them being senior.
* We did a campus drive \(our first time\) exclusive to women from nid’s and srihari's college. Akshatha was hired from that initiative. We plan to go again in every year.
* This is the 2nd year we’re running a summer internship exclusive to women, and lgbtq folks.
* We’re sponsoring conference attendance, running ClojureBridge, creating policies for women, etc.
* Getting more women applicants is a long term problem for us to work on. We don’t expect a couple of small initiatives we take to solve the inequality in the industry, or even just in nilenso. We plan to keep at it, and find ways to do more.

## How do people learn new skills at nilenso? Do you have a different way for employees to skill up?

* Explicit learning: We have run internal and external Haskell classes,
* Pushing sales: We wanted to work with a specific client because we wanted to do Clojure. We then spent a couple months learning Clojure to work with them, and did that. We’re doing the same thing with Haskell and other clients now.
* Rotating across projects: People can move from one project to another to learn something they want.
* Between projects: People choose to take off a couple of weeks, or a month to explicitly skill up, between projects. This is a very normal thing to do. On an average, this happens once a year for a person.
* [Try new things](https://nilenso.com/decisions/bdr005-try-new-things.html): We actively pick up experiments to skill up, and plan to continue doing this.
* [Sabbaticals](https://nilenso.com/decisions/bdr017-sabbatical-policy.html): These happen even less often, but we’ve had some success here.

## How would you deal with employees taking longer time off for health reasons? Are there precedents for this kind of extended absence?

* We have an unlimited “Very Sick” [leave policy](https://vyakaran.nilenso.com/policy/leaves). In past, a bunch of us fell sick with dengue, for example.
* If possible, clients are informed in advance, and measures are taken to hand off active initiatives to other people before the leave. For persistent, or non “very sick” leaves like migraines, or RSIs, or mental health issues that some of us have had in the past, we’ve informed our clients, and they’ve all generally understood us, and accommodated it. We do not have a policy about extended time-off for them, we do have detailed and inclusive [medical cover](https://vyakaran.nilenso.com/health-and-safety/medical-insurance).
