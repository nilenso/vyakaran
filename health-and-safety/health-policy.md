# Health policy

We care about the mental and physical well-being of you and your loved ones.

### Psychological care

Your psychological well being is as or more important than your physical health. nilenso therefore reimburses any expenses (consultation, therapy, medication and any other expenses relating to your mental well being) up to INR 1L/year for you, your partner, parents or children.

In order to protect your privacy, there is a separate process to claim health related reimbursements.

* Send an email to <mark style="color:blue;">nilensohealth@nilenso.com</mark> with a copy of the invoice that you would like to be reimbursed for
  * This email is only accessible to the suits and admin (who will be processing the reimbursement)
* You will be reimbursed via bank transfer
* We respect your confidentiality. Unless requested by our auditors, the contents of this email will not be shared with anyone

We understand that it's not always easy to find help when you need it, so we've tied up with [Alternative Story](https://alternativestory.in/) (AS) to reduce the friction involved in finding a good counsellor.

**Booking a session**

* To book a 1:1 therapy session with a counsellor, visit the partner link   &#x20;
  * [Existing Users](https://thealternativestory.as.me/partnerorgexist)
  * [New Users](https://thealternativestory.as.me/partnerorgsnew)
* Select Partner Orgs
  * Partner Orgs - New clients - 1:1 therapy for the first session
  * Partner Orgs - Existing clients - 1:1 therapy for subsequent sessions
* Choose a counsellor, and a date/time that works for you
* Book Appointment
  * Provide your nilenso email so we are billed for the session. This information will not be shared with anyone outside AS

**Choosing a counsellor**

* You can pick a counsellor based on their [profiles](https://alternativestory.in/team-of-psychologists-in-bangalore-and-bombay-counselling-courses/).
* If you don't vibe with your counsellor, either speak to them so they can recommend someone else, or write to AS. It's important to find the right fit, so please don't hesitate to change your counsellor if you feel things aren't working for you
* They don't have psychiatrists on staff, but can refer to someone if needed (Note: counsellors offer therapy, psychiatrists prescribe meds)

**Modalities**

* Sessions are held over phone call, video call, email or chat based on your preference
* Sessions are 45-60 min
* The number of sessions you need would be decided by the counsellor and you

If you are working with a counsellor outside Alternative Story, we will still cover all related expenses as per our existing policy.
