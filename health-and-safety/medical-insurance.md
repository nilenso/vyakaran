# Medical cover

We care about the mental and physical well-being of you and your loved ones.

### Psychological care

Your psychological well being is as or more important than your physical health. nilenso therefore reimburses any expenses (consultation, therapy, medication and any other expenses relating to your mental well being) up to INR 1L/year for you, your partner, parents or children.

We understand that you may not be comfortable claiming a reimbursement for a medical expense with your doctor. There is there a separate process designed to protect your privacy.

* Send an email to <mark style="color:blue;">healthmatters@nilenso.com</mark> with a copy of the invoice that you would like to be reimbursed for
  * This email is only accessible to the suits and admin (who will be processing the reimbursement)
* You will be reimbursed via bank transfer
* We respect your confidentiality. Unless requested by our auditors, the contents of this email will not be shared with anyone

### Healthcare

Medical care is expensive, so all our employees and their family â€” parents, children and spouses are covered by a comprehensive insurance policy (this means cashless, all ailments covered, pre-existing conditions included, no bureaucracy policy), where nilenso pays 100% of the premium.

Any expenses related to medical emergencies that are not covered by our insurance provider (for instance if your family is outside India) will be taken care of by nilenso.
