# Information for clients

As of March 2020, that we have decided to adopt the following health measures at nilenso in response to the escalating situation around COVID-19. 

We have requested that all our employees work from home till further notice. We will continue to monitor the situation and update our evaluation as more information becomes available.

  
We have a lot of experience operating remotely, and will work to ensure that this does not result in any disruption.  
  
**What you can expect from us**  
1. Extensive communication on Slack and the other channels in place at your organisation.

2. Explicit communication about availability \(including breaks\) while working from home.

3. Communication over video chat \(where possible\) to stay connected.  
  
If thereâ€™s anything else we can do to align ourselves with your teams, please do let us know.

  
Looking forward to a couple of productive and healthy work-from-home weeks.
