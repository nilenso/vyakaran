# Information for employees

### **Emergency response**

Due to the escalating urgency of this situation, we are requesting that you all follow a work-from-home protocol till further notice. Keeping employee safety in mind, we will likely extend this policy beyond the lockdown. This is an evolving situation that we are monitoring closely. We will keep you updated regarding any changes.

### **Staying updated during this time**

Reliable sources of information include the [The Ministry of Health and Welfare](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) for India, and the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and [Centre for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html).

### **Working from home**

In relation to the wfh policy we have instituted, please feel free to take any of these home from the office as needed. The easiest way might be to collectively book a cab or a small transport vehicle through blowhorn \([https://blowhorn.com/](https://blowhorn.com/)\) and have them drop off whatever you need at each of your homes.

* monitors
* keyboards
* wrist rests
* mice
* webcams
* headphones
* chairs
* tables

We want to equip you so you can be effective and comfortable while working from home. Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to support you during this time.

To re-emphasize the best practices around remote work,

* Please try to have work / life separation, in whatever way that is achievable. A work-only room or desk is ideal. A separate machine for work would be great, but if nothing else, have a work profile on your laptop that you only use for work. Please don't work from your bed! It's terrible posture, and isn't great for your mental well being either.
* Take regular breaks to stretch, hydrate and just chill out.
* Don't work all the time! Make time for leisure activities.
* Communicate extensively on Slack. Let your colleagues and clients know when you're starting work, taking breaks, signing off for the day and about outages or other disruptions to work.
* Communicate over video chat where possible to stay connected.

### **Staying connected**

Join our virtual watercooler on jitsi \(the link is available on \#remote on Slack\) when you're taking a break if you feel like hanging out with your colleagues and playing some games.

Our weekly standups are on as always.

### **Final thoughts**

Lastly, everyone is different. There's a lot you're dealing with right now. Cut yourself some slack if you're not as productive as you'd like to be. 

if you are unwell, please get the medical attention and rest that you need. If you need to take time off for yourself or to care for someone, please do so without any hesitation. Nothing is more important than your health and the health of your loved ones.

We will be sending out an update to all of our clients to let them know about our COVID response policy.  
  
If you have any concerns, please reach out to Deepa, Ravi or Srihari over email or phone.
