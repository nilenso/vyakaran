## Emergency response

Since the pandemic hit in early 2020, we have transitioned to working as a fully remote team, which enabled several of our team members to make the decision to move back home to be with their families. While that has provided much support, we are all still grappling with what is happening to us, and around us. The situation in many parts of India is particularly serious.

At this time, we feel that having some additional time off will help us deal with the stress that we are under a little better. We announced Fridays off for 6 months (May through October), which was intended to cover the wave we were experiencing at the time, and an anticipated wave months down the line. We moved to Friday 50% off after October and continued with that till March, 2022. We have since transitioned to getting back to work full time on Fridays.

## What you can expect from us

1. Someone from our team should have reached out to you to discuss what works best for the team
2. Extensive communication around availability and minimal disruption to the project
3. As always, billing only for time spent by us on the project

If thereâ€™s anything else we can do to align ourselves with your teams, please do let us know.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding. We look forward to emerging together on the other side.

If you have any concerns, please reach out to us at business@nilenso.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
