### Emergency response

As of May 2021, it has been over a year since we first reached out to you about the health measures we had adopted at nilenso in response to the pandemic.

We have since transitioned to working as a fully remote team, which enabled several of our team members to make the decision to move back home to be with their families. While that has provided much support, we are all still grappling with what is happening to us, and around us. The situation in many parts of India is particularly serious.

At this time, we feel that having some additional time off will help us deal with the stress that we are under a little better. Taking inspiration from what some of our clients and colleagues have put in place, we are announcing Fridays off for the next 6 months (May through October) at nilenso. This timeframe is intended to cover the current wave we are experiencing, and an anticipated third wave a few months down the line.

### What you can expect from us
1. Someone from our team should have reached out to you to discuss what works best for the team
2. Extensive communication around availability and minimal disruption to the project
3. Billing only for time spent by us on the project

If thereâ€™s anything else we can do to align ourselves with your teams, please do let us know.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding. We look forward to emerging together on the other side.

If you have any concerns, please reach out to us at business@nilenso.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
