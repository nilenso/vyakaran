* Have a `dedicated workspace`, preferably a separate room. If you don't have that, a separate table. If you don't have that, a separate computer for your non-work computing. Essentially you want to emphasize your work/life boundaries
* Stick with office wear which you'd wear to an office. Pick these with the same care that you'd give to office wear.
* If you have the option to work from elsewhere, do that once in a while
* If you live with other people make sure they understand you're working. This won't be easy
* Backups, backups, backups. Network, computer, peripherals, phone, electricity. Work out surge protection, thunderstorms and anything else that happens where you are. Stick with 80/20 rule here i.e. don't have to go all the way to the extent of switching to your backup network within a millisecond. Figure out beforehand where things could be serviced if they fail, have an idea of possible downtimes for something in the chain and design around that. (E.g. my electricity goes off once in a while, but the downtimes is in minutes, so my UPS and backup network is arranged accordingly. For the black-swan event of my electricity being away for a day, i have a friend's home within 40 minutes to work out of.) Work out this stuff beforehand, you don't want to decide when things break.
* Keep consistent hours, let people know what these are, let people know when you change them
* Have a remote pairing setup where you can switch consistently.
* Working-form-home consistently can be mentally exhausting. Make sure you socialize religiously! Make sure you socialize with others (non-RTSL folks) in the office
* Resist the temptation to keep coming back to your work computer. Initially you'll do this a lot, wean yourself off it with time.
* You will have more `blue` days compared to working in an office. Be prepared. Take off when needed.
* Move a lot, take regular breaks, stretch, protect your eyes (The usual desk setup guidelines e.g. OSHA and desk stretches apply)
