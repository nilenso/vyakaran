## scoping

* inceptions are mostly about “why”
* try to cut similar sized chunks of work
* alternatively, estimate t-shirt sizes: S/M/L or 1, 2, 3
* PM, customer, QA should estimate as a sanity check ONLY
* designers’ estimates can be included with devs’ estimates
* try to estimate on a weekly basis... anything finer grained than that is likely self-delusion
* fill up 3 weeks and take an average, and then check: does it feel right?

## measurement

* “yeserday’s weather” is *usually* very accurate
* if you don't have yesterday's weather, default to 2 points or M
* give yourself a wider window (2 or 3 weeks) to avoid sharp spikes at Holi
* prefer one week iterations as a basic skeleton
* prefer the simplest estimation possible
* never change estimation approach mid-project
* DO NOT compensate for “irregularities” – sick leave is real, holidays are real
* consider making an exception for dengue, sabbaticals, etc.


## projection

* take what was measured, mark it against the scope, project into the future
* do not adjust, do not compensate, do not pad work/estimates
* pad the end (of a release, of a project) for inevitable changes
* be honest with everyone about what you see

## is the software done? how do you know?

actually try to answer this question

* acceptance criteria – who wrote them? did they check?
* testing – what kinds?
* deployed – where?
* used – by whom?
* feature flags – which ones?
* old features – removed or disabled?
* old data – deprecated or deleted?
* old APIs – backward-compatible, deprecated, or deleted? client libraries?
* “just one more thing” – is there anything pending on your plate?
* answer this: what happens if you die tomorrow?

* dependencies – who owns them?
* follow-up – who’s talking? who’s fault is it if it doesn’t happen? (YOURS)
* what happens if the entire team dies tomorrow?
  maturity means:
    * process
    * documentation
    * automation
    * eliminate process altogether (zero work, not ad-hoc work)


## guidelines

* README: central starting point 1a) sub-projects and meta-readme (wiki)
* publish everything
* list stakeholders
* capture a TODO list: project wall | Executive
* capture HOW-TOs: documentation | Operations
