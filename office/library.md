# Library

We <3 books! We have a well-stocked library with physical books in the office, and a [virtual library](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1iKdbJ-miScUkgySHV0bW9DMnc?usp=sharing) with e-books.

You are welcome to borrow any book from the library. When you borrow a book, do add a card with the details on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/s3yMgsQv/inventory) and tag yourself on the card. To indicate that you've returned the book, simply untag yourself.

Feel free to add to our collection by purchasing any book you like via the credit card details available in the vault. If you're new and don't have access to the vault yet, just ask a colleague for help.
