# Workstation

Every workstation at nilenso is equipped with the following by default.

* Desk and chair
* Laptop, charger and adapter
* Keyboard, wrist rest and mouse
* Monitor
* Webcam
* Headphones
* Utilities
* Miscellaneous phone chargers and cables

The default specs for the hardware are mentioned below. We tend to upgrade when a newer model is available, unless someone has a strong preference to not do so. Please get in touch with our Operations Team if you'd like help buying or replacing any equipment at your workstation.

## Desk and chair

Our desks are custom-made to suit different height requirements. We also have Haworth standing desks in the office if you prefer. Please ensure that the minimum and maximum desk heights are to your comfort.

Our chairs are fully adjustable and from either Featherlite or Haworth.
