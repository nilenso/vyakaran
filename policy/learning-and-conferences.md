# Learning and conferences

### Learning

We don’t have a formal limit on what you can spend on education. Employees are free to use the company credit card to buy books — technical or otherwise as well as pay for courses online or offline. 

We also try to host educational events at the office — from Haskell lessons to technical talks (if you haven’t been to XTC — eXtreme Tuesday’s Club, ask us for an invite).

### Conferences

nilenso will reimburse any expenses (travel and stay) that are not covered by conference organisers for any relevant conference you are invited to speak at. 

For conferences you would like to attend but are not speaking at, nilenso will always cover the ticket costs. If there is travel and hotel stay required, nilenso will cover expenses as long as we have not already exceeded the annual budget for the year.

Be reasonable with regards to expenses related to travel and stay.
