### Making a purchase <a href="#making-a-purchase" id="making-a-purchase"></a>

When signing up for new services, use bills@nilenso.com or forward a copy of the invoice to bills@nilenso.com. Where possible, add the login details to vault, so the subscription can be managed without your involvement.

In the invoice, include the company's GSTIN/GST number: 29AAKFN2903R1ZM

Invoices for any company card spends are required by the accounts team. Please fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchvhzwBAcUXrZfH3dq7einvmpLqqZFzBBE1FzV4IY2whAyYA/viewform?pli=1) and attach the receipt along with it.&#x20;

Additionally, for recurring subscriptions, ensure that our admin team is in the loop so they can track the expense.
