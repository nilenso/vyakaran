# Claiming reimbursements

### Claiming a reimbursement using kulu <a id="claiming-a-reimbursement-using-kulu"></a>

kulu is our internal expense tracking solution. Make sure you have an account on kulu before claiming a reimbursement.

#### Through email <a id="through-email"></a>

* You can only send mails if you have an account under the ''nilenso'' team.
* Only submit a single attachment per email, if you have multiple reimbursements, send multiple emails
* kulu only picks the biggest attachment \(in size\) if more than one is attached
* Mention the details in the subject, these will be used as remarks
* PDFs / Images are legit \(beware of inline attachments -- these don't work :\( \)
* Send the email to the **reimbursements email** if you need to be reimbursed for a purchase you made
* The best use-case is when receive an invoice over email. You can just hit forward and send it to kulu \(preferably remove the text "fwd" from the subject\)
