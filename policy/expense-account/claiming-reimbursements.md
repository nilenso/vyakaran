# Claiming reimbursements

### Claiming a reimbursement <a href="#claiming-a-reimbursement-using-kulu" id="claiming-a-reimbursement-using-kulu"></a>

* The operations team uses a Drive folder bookmarked on the [#reimbursements](https://nilenso.slack.com/archives/C0429CP6TMJ) channel to manage everyone's reimbursements.
* At the end of every month, the ops team creates a folder and a spreadsheet for that month.
* Add entries for all your reimbursements in the sheet with a serial number. You'll need to attach invoices for each entry.
* Rename each invoice to the serial number from the sheet. Upload them to the month's drive folder.
* Reimbursements will be credited with next monthâ€™s salary.
