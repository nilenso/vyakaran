### Statutory holidays

There are 5 statutory holidays, during which the office will remain closed.

* Republic Day \(Jan 26th\), 
* Labour Day \(May 1st\),
* Independence Day \(Aug 15th\), 
* Gandhi Jayanti \(Oct 2nd\) and 
* Rajyotsava \(Nov 1st\) 

### Parental leave

We believe parenting is a joy and a responsibility that should be shared by all parents. Anyone welcoming a newborn is offered 6 months paid and a further 6 months unpaid leave.

### Vacation or sick leave

The remaining 28 days can be taken off as needed.

### Menstrual leave

nilenso offers paid menstrual leave for anyone who needs it, no questions asked.

### Very sick leave

Serious illness is not considered as leave.

### Unpaid leave

Unpaid leave is available during the year if required. Salary deducted will be calculated based on number of calendar days \(not working days\) in the month of the leaves.

### Borrowing future leaves

We know that important personal events require extended periods of time off from work, but can be trying. Rather than taking unpaid leave, up to 10 leaves can be "borrowed" from the next calendar year if required.
