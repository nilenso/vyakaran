# Taking leave

No one _approves_ leaves at nilenso. We trust you to manage your leaves, and keep the relevant people informed.

* Send an e-mail to your client (this should be discussed as early as possible)
* Send an e-mail to leaves@nilenso.com
* Mark the days in the [leaves calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/0?cid=bmlsZW5zby5jb21fMnR2YXRkMGJnbDdhcmUxNjZyc3M5ZXY2aW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
* Mark the days as leaves in [Harvest](https://nilenso.harvestapp.com/time) against **Leaves** (make sure you are added to this project)
