Once the complaint is received by the Committee:

1. The Committee shall take cognizance of the complaint at the earliest and in any case within 10 days of receiving the complaint. A complete copy of the complaint and other supporting documents, shall be sent to the respondent within 10 days of receiving the complaint. The person who is accused by the complainant will be informed that a complaint has been filed against them \(they will be made aware of the details of the allegation and also the name of the complainant as it would be necessary for proper inquiry\) and no unfair acts of retaliation or unethical action will be tolerated. I. Nilenso will not accept, support or tolerate retaliation in any form against any employee who, acting in good faith, reports suspected misconduct, asks questions or raises concerns. II. Any person who engages in such retaliation directly or indirectly, or encourages others to do so, may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Retaliation will be treated as a major misconduct. Retaliation against those reporting sexual harassment is prohibited by this policy. Retaliation means and includes any hurtful employment action against an individual III. Anyone suspecting or experiencing retaliation should report to the appropriate authorities as prescribed in this policy. IV. Retaliation cases are treated as seriously as an alleged case of sexual harassment even if the original harassment complaint is not proven.
2. The complainant has the opportunity to ask for conciliation proceedings. This shall be initiated only if requested by the aggrieved person. A request for conciliation should be made within 2 weeks of receipt of reply from the respondent. Please note that in such conciliation the complainant cannot demand monetary compensation. It should be made clear to all parties that conciliation in itself doesn’t necessarily mean acceptance of complaint by the respondent. It is a practical mechanism through which issues are resolved or misunderstandings cleared.
3. In case a settlement is arrived at, the committee will record & report the same to the employer for taking appropriate action. If conciliation fails and/or no settlement is reached between the parties, the Committee shall proceed to conduct a formal inquiry into the complaint. The Committee shall provide the copies of the settlement as recorded during conciliation to the complainant and the respondent. If the matter has been settled by conciliation but the respondent is not complying with the terms and conditions, the aggrieved party can approach the Committee for formal redressal through an inquiry process. The Committee shall proceed with making a formal inquiry within 7 days of receiving such notice/ request.
4. The Committee shall conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation of a complaint as necessary and appropriate, in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The Committee will question both the complainant and the alleged accused separately. If required, the person who has been named as a witness will need to provide the necessary information to assist in resolving the matter satisfactorily. The Committee shall call upon all witnesses mentioned by both the parties. The Committee shall also call upon any witnesses it feels may provide necessary and vital information in regards to the inquiry. An aggrieved person or respondent shall not question each other or other witnesses directly but may raise questions to be asked of that party through the Committee, which will determine whether to ask them. The minutes of the proceedings of the Committee shall be recorded in English and where the aggrieved person or the respondent is not conversant with English, in addition, in such language as may be familiar to them. At least 3 members of the Committee, including one woman member, shall be present for each hearing. If a party is not present for more than 3 consecutive hearings, without sufficient cause, the Committee may, after giving that party a notice of 15 days, give an ex parte decision on the complaint. The Committee will make every effort to complete its investigation within 90 days of a complaint of sexual harassment.
5. The Committee can ask for specific documents from a person if it feels that they are important for the purpose of investigation.
6. The complainant has the option to seek transfer or leave so that the inquiry process can continue smoothly and to prevent recurrence of similar situations or discomfort to the complainant. The leave can extend for a maximum period of 3 months. Leave granted under this provision will be paid leave and will not be counted in the number of leaves that the complainant is statutorily entitled to. The complainant may be required to work from home, if it is practicable, keeping in mind the nature of work of the complainant, health and mental condition. However, the complainant is under a good faith obligation and shall not abuse the process to request unjustifiably long periods of leave, keeping in mind the economic effects of the leave to the organization. The Committee shall have the discretion to grant leave of an appropriate duration, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, or grant an alternate measure such as transferring the employee or the accused, as it deems fit. The Committee shall also take note of the inherent power asymmetry and/or the vulnerability of the aggrieved person in such cases and take steps to ensure that the aggrieved person is not subjected to a hostile environment during the investigation.
7. The Inquiry Report of the Committee, including its decision and recommendations, and reasons for arriving at such decision, shall be communicated to the concerned parties and the employer, in writing, at the earliest and in any case within 10 days of completion of the investigation. Notification of the decision and the reasons shall be individually given to the respondent and the aggrieved person on the same day. Explanation: A “hostile environment” is said to be created when filing of the complaint or proceedings of the Committee have the direct or indirect purpose or effect of interfering with the aggrieved person’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive employment or living environment.
8. The investigation shall be completed within 3 months of the receipt of the complaint. If the investigation reveals that the complainant has been sexually harassed as claimed, the accused will be subjected to disciplinary action accordingly.
9. The report of the investigation shall be supplied to the employer \(or the District Officer\), the accused and the complainant within 10 days of completion of the investigation.
10. The employer or the District Officer will act on the recommendations of the Committee within 60 days of the receipt of the report.
11. The contents of the complaint made, the identity and addresses of the complainant, respondent and witnesses, any information relating to conciliation and inquiry proceedings, recommendations of the Internal Committee and the action taken by the employer shall not be published, communicated or made known to the public, press and media in any manner. Any person contravening the confidentiality clause is subject to disciplinary action as prescribed in the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.
12. Where the Committee arrives at the conclusion that the allegation against the respondent is malicious, or the aggrieved party or any other person making the complaint has made the complaint knowing it to be false or the aggrieved person or any other person making the complaint has produced any forged or misleading document, it may recommend to the employer to take action against the aggrieved person or the person making the complaint. While deciding malicious intent, the Committee should consider that mere inability to substantiate a complaint need not mean malicious intent. Malicious intent must be clearly established through a separate inquiry.
13. Any party aggrieved by the report can prefer an appeal in the appropriate Court or Tribunal in accordance with the service rules within 90 days of the recommendation been given to the employer/ District Officer.

### Disciplinary Action

Where any misconduct is found by the Committee, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against the accused, up to and including termination of contract. This action shall be in addition to any legal recourse sought by the complainant.

Below is a list of disciplinary actions that may be recommended by the IC:

* Formal apology toward the complainant
* Suspension
* Transfer
* Undergoing mandatory refresher training on sexual harassment
* Formal warning letter
* Withholding of pay
* Withholding of bonus

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and the committee may choose to recommend an action beyond the scope of this list.

If it is found out through evidence by the Committee that the complainant has maliciously given a false complaint against the accused, disciplinary action shall be taken against the complainant as well.

Regardless of the outcome of the complaint made in good faith, the employee lodging the complaint and any person providing information or any witness, will be protected from any form of retaliation. While dealing with complaints of sexual harassment, the Committee shall ensure that the complainant or the witness are not victimized or discriminated against by the accused. Any unwarranted pressures, retaliatory or any other type of unethical behavior by the accused against the complainant while the investigation is in progress should be reported by the complainant to the Complaints Committee as soon as possible. Disciplinary action will be taken by the Committee against any such complaints which are found genuine.

This policy shall be disseminated to each employee of the company as well as new recruits who will have to acknowledge that they have read and understood the policy and that they shall abide by the policy.
